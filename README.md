A REST API that connects [Raid Bot](https://github.com/dylanaz45/raid-bot) to a MongoDB database. BeautifulSoup was 
used to obtain majority of the data for the database. This is the JavaScript version of my API, which also features
token based authentication.

## Features 
* A system that allows users to register a den they are currently hosting and allows other users to see what raids are
currently active.
* Data for all dens that can be found in the base game and in the Isle of Armor DLC.
* Shiny sprites of requested Pok√©mon including regional forms, mega evolutions, and other forms.
* A database of quotes and dad jokes.

## Credits
* [Serebii](https://serebii.net/) for the data on the dens
* The Pokemon Company, Nintendo, and Game Freak
